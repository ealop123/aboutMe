      <h2>I want to unlock the brain</h2>
      <p>Since a young age I have been facinated with the brain and human conciousness. I have decided to clarify neurochemistry. The best way I can explain my long term goal is, translating neurochemical activity into human conciousness. More accurately
        describe how the experience of being alive is related to how our brain is operating. I believe the best way to do this is through mechiene learning. Essentially making a <a class="offSite" href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-put-worm-brain-in-lego-robot-openworm-connectome">robot brain</a>.<br>

        There is already initiative to upload the human species into a matrix type utopia, this is not my goal. The research I want to be involved in may contribute to fundemental knowledge nessacary for those technologies. <b>More immediately valueable:</b>        understanding how what the human species experiences, and the chemical activitiy inside the brain, go hand in hand. This could revolutionize our understanding and treatment of alzheimer's, mental illness, and the human condition </p>
      <h2>Heading a Research Team</h2>
      <p>The place I feel I would best fit in this aspiration is headding a research team. I want to understand the sciences nessacary to move in the right direction, but deligate tasks to experts in specific fields. I want to represent the team, keep the
        purpose clear, communication efficent, and funding plentaful. I am not fit for this position yet. I believe there is a need for this research, and I believe I have the passion and ambition to equip my life to uncovering these goals.</p>
      <h2>How to get there</h2>
      <p>Education is my current step. My goal major is Biochemistry with double minor in Computer Science and Buisness. I will eventually move into either Neurochemistry or Pharmacology for my grad work. The education step is large on its own, and expensive
        too. I have to pay for school, which has been a problem. Fortunately, as of January 29th, my father has generously given me his Navy benifits to education. I will have 12 months of school paid by the government, and housing allowance during that
        time. With these twelve months I will not only study my regular subjects, but obtain marketable skills in computer science. </p>
      <h2>Long term financing</h2>
      <p>I would prefer to pay for my school out of pocket. I just need a profession that is flexible enough to layer in with school. Web design is my current study, which I will potentially obtain a certificate for this next semester. With a continueing
        understanding of computer science I will be able to find work that supports myself while going to school.</p>
      <h2>What have I done?</h2>
      <p>I continue to value peace of mind as a lifestyle. It is impossible for me to stand firmly in reality if I do not know the legs I stand upon, nor the mind I work with. To achieve inner peace, I have studied motivational authors such as Zig Ziglar
        and Dale Carnegie. I have studided the four noble truths and eightfold path of Buddhism. With a good foundation I have pushed myself constantly outside of my comfort zone, socalizing in new situations. I have worked going door to door with sales-like
        companies, learning how buisness works. I spent a summer selling water on the beach. If you want to look over <a href="my resume">my resume</a> feel free.</p>
      <h2>That's Me</h2>
      <p>I think that about sums it up. If you have any questions or requests, feel free to <a href="ask me">ask me</a></p>
