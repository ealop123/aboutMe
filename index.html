              <b>Hello</b> everyone, my name is Ezekiel and <b>I am excited to be a student at Palomar college.</b> <br>
              <img alt="PALOMAR COLLEGE" src="./imgs/palomarLogo.png"> <br>
              I have a <a href="me">clear dream</a> that I think will have an incredible impact on society. I am ambitiously chasing my dreams with the step I believe most important now, <b>I am getting an education.</b>
            </p>
            <p id="problem"><b>Unfortunately,</b> the <a href="explain this">GI benefits</a> my father has very generously given me do not kick in until the end of May, and I have expenses now. I have struggled and dropped classes trying to work full time while going to school before. I do not want this to happen again</p>
            <p id="solution"><b>I thought,</b> why not try a <a href="./">creative solution</a> and implement some of the skills I am learning right now to find people willing to make a safe investment in <a href="my grades">my education</a>. I will certainly be receiving assistance for living expenses from the VA, and if you are willing to lend me your money now to make sure I can focus entirely on my grades, I am happy to appreciate the investment above standard investment expectations</p>
            <p id="opposition"><b>I am</b> going to ask my close family and friends to invest what they can through this website. Some people I know may not be in a position to give two months worth of living money, but this website will allow anyone to invest what they reasonably can, and I can hit my goal quickly, getting on with my life. <br>
              <img src="my life" alt="me studying"><br>
              I have <a href="GI section">proof</a> that I will be receiving VA benefits for those that are less familiar with me, but still interested in making a safe investment.<br>
              <img src="stocks rising" alt="your investment will go up"><br>
               In addition, for the course of these two months, I will be completely transparent with my expenses and update this website with everything I spend money on. I also have a <a href="tight budget">tight budget</a> on what I need to make it through these next two months, so you can be sure I am not going to throw a wild party with three full boxes of alcohol (p.s. I don't drink). Feel free to read more <a href="about me">about me</a> too.</p>
